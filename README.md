## Project Phases
- [Project Phase 1](https://github.com/Waariss/ITCS431_Software-Design-and-Development/tree/main/Project%20Phase%201)
- Project Phase 2
  - **Gemini Project**
    - In the Gemini Project, I demonstrated leadership and in-depth understanding of various software engineering diagrams. This project necessitated the creation of Use Case, Activity, Sequence, Class diagrams to design and effectively document a complex telescope system. I demonstrated my proficiency in Java and Spring Boot by implementing the project as a web application, enabling the generation of intricate science plans for telescope systems. This endeavor refined my technical acumen and underscored my ability to translate complex systems into understandable and functional software solutions.
